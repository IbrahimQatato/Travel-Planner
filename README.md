##Info

This is a desktop app for calculating visa free entry periods and planning travel without needing a visa into the Schengen zone. The user can enter different travel dates and calculate the remaining days they have for free entry. In addition they can use this app to find out when they can re-enter the Schengen zone. 

## Usage

Choose planned entry and exit periods into the EU schengen zone, press `Add` to add more travel periods and `Remove` to remove the last added period. When all the dates are entered the user can click `Calculate` to calculate the stays. The program outputs whether the planned trip is viable for visa-free-entry passport holders and then if viable it shows the remaining days. Beside each travel period it will also mention when that period gets renewed if the user wants to re-enter the Schengen zone.
